<h1>CONSTRUCTION</h1>

<h1>DRIVER</h1>
<li>	The <code>hex</code> table is initialized so that hexadecimal
	characters point to their corresponding values. This
	is done for the convenience of the decoding procedures
	in <code>o()</code>.
<li>	<code>prog</code> is the memory buffer where our program's machine
	code will be generated. <code>pc</code> is the "program counter"
	and counts the bytes have been generated. <code>pc</code> starts at
	0 because it is static.
<li>	The built-in functions are initialized next with
	<code>lend()</code>. <code>lend()</code> simply declares a function, and
	changes it's address to the address of the given
	function relative to the <code>prog</code>.
<li>	<code>sf</code> is loaded with the source file. A terse diagnostic
	error is issued if it is unavailible. Note that <code>ln</code>,
	line number, and <code>back</code> are 0.
<li>	Load the first non-blank character into <code>nc</code>,
	"next character", for the lexical analyzer.
<li>	_<code>top()</code> is run until there are no more tokens in the
	file at which point it is closed and the source
	translation phase is complete.
<li>	If any unresolved references exist, an error is raised.
<li>	The machine code is generated for for loading the data
	and program pointer registers and jumping to the
	program's main().
<li>	The binary file is created and the program is run.

<h1>LEXICAL ANALYSIS</h1>
<li>	The lexical analyzer uses a one-token and one-character
	look-ahead, so it assumes the first character of a
	token is already loaded in <code>nc</code>, "next character".
	<code>oc</code>, "old character", is technically not necessary
	but it is convenient.
<li>	Initial whitespace is skipped. Tokens can either be
	responsible for skipping space before or after
	themselves. This compiler makes tokens skip spaces
	after since it has the property that <code>nc</code> will then
	point to the start of the next token, which slightly
	extends the look-ahead one token and the type of the
	second.
<li>	All tokens can be classified into exactly one kind by
	its first character. This means signed numbers are not
	single numbers but the combination of the sign as an
	operator and the literal positive number.
<li>	<code>next()</code> loads the next token into <code>tok</code> and returns the
	first character. It does not attempt to validate or
	process the token in any way, except for setting <code>top</code>,
	"token operator". In particular, this means that the
	caller must read and process the characters of a string
	after the quote. <code>quote()</code> is processes string
	characters and escape sequences. <code>back</code> signals that
	<code>tok</code> is already loaded. This is used to implement
	token look-ahead by calling <code>next()</code>, examining its
	token, and setting <code>back</code> to true.

<h1>MACHINE CODE CONVENTIONS</h1>
<li>	Machine code is generated immediately upon parsing. This
	generates profoundly inefficient code but is very
	simple to implement.
<li>	<code>eax</code> is used as "the value" of an expression. <code>ecx</code>
	is used temporarily as the left side of binary
	expressions.
<li>	<code>ebp</code> is used as the "base pointer". Local variables and
	temporaries extend from <code>esp</code> to <code>ebp</code>, the earliest
	variables having the lowest address. <code>ebp</code> and the word
	after it are the old value of <code>esp</code> and the return
	address of the routine, respectively. <code>ebp+8</code> and beyond
	are the arguments, the earliest having the lowest
	address.
<li>	"cdecl" calling convention is used since the native
	support functions use it and only the caller knows how
	many arguments have been pushed on the stack. This means
	the <code>eax</code> register holds the return value, arguments are
	stored so that the first argument has the lowest address
	on the stack, and the caller must remove the arguments.
<li>	<code>esi</code> and <code>edi</code> point to the base of <code>prog</code> and the
	data area, respectively. These ensure that every
	variable is accessed relative to a base register and to
	generate code for globals, functions, and locals, you
	only need to specify which.
<li>	<code>ebx</code> points to the literal string ROM.
<li>	<code>o()</code> takes a hexadecimal string and outputs them as
	bytes into <code>prog</code> at <code>pc</code>. A comment explaining the
	machine code means in assembly should follow after a
	space. <code>oi()</code> is generates the given machine code and
	then outputs a word-long integer. Both functions return
	the value of <code>pc</code> after they are done.
<li>	<code>patch()</code> resolves a "chain" of references to all point
	to <code>pc</code>. It first reads the value refered to at <code>at</code> in
	<code>prog</code> then changes it to point to <code>pc</code>, (accounting
	for the fact that jumps take relative addresses if
	<code>rel</code> is set). It does the same if the previous value
	stored at that address was not 0. With this, an unbound
	number of references are stored with one pointer, for
	example <code>brkj</code>, "break jump".
	
<h1>PROGRAM TRANSLATION</h1>
<li>	All translation routines are prefixed with an underscore
	("_") and expression translators are suffixed with "e"
	to avoid pre-defined name clashes with certain c
	compilers.
<li>	This compiler uses a recursive descent technique for
	parsing statements and expressions. Each element of
	the syntax has a routine that implements it; _<code>exp()</code>
	implements expressions, for example. Within an
	expression, there are sub-elements like prefixes, which
	will be implemented in _<code>pree()</code>. _<code>exp()</code> will call
	_<code>pree()</code> whenever it needs to read a prefix expression
	hence the "descent" in "recursive descent". Expressions
	may be embedded in expressions with parentheses, hence
	the "recursive".
<li>	_<code>top()</code> is a top-level declaration element. _<code>decl()</code>
	defines the declaration global symbol with the name and
	type that start all declarations. If a semicolon
	follows, the declaration was a variable. If not, this
	is a function. Decrement the number of globals, <code>nglo</code>,
	because it was incremented on the speculation that
	the declaration would be a variable. <code>nloc</code> and <code>npar</code>
	are the number of locals and parameters, respectively.
	<code>enter</code> is generated to set up the stack frame. Since
	the number of locals the function declares is not known
	yet, the operands must be filled in after parsing the
	body. <code>xor eax,eax; leave; ret</code> is generated to restore
	the previous frame and return 0. <code>nsym</code>, is reset to
	un-declare the locals.
<li>	_<code>stmnt()</code> is mostly straight-forward. The first new
	feature comes in the implementation of <code>if</code>, which
	uses jumps. <code>elsej</code> and <code>endj</code> are chains of references
	to the else statement and the statement after the
	entire if statement. Both are resolved with <code>patch()</code>.
	<code>brkj</code> and <code>contj</code> are the reference chain to <code>break</code>
	and the address, itself, of the top of a loop,
	respectively. <code>goto</code>() introduces the first use of
	<code>cka()</code>, "check attribute" to make sure that the type
	of expression after <code>goto</code> is a function.
<li>	As discussed in the lexical analysis section, skipping
	the space after a token allows us to preview the first
	character of the token after the look-ahead by
	examining <code>nc</code>. This is used to parse labels. Without
	this, the parser would have had to have been
	restructured to expect the first token of the element
	to have already been loaded into <code>tok</code>, which requires
	that every element remember to load one more token than
	it uses.
<li>	Expression parsers parses its element and returns a type
	that may be adorned with a flag, <code>TAR</code>, which indicates
	that it may be a target for assignment. If <code>TAR</code> is set,
	the value in <code>eax</code> is the /address/ of the value of the
	element instead of the value itself. <code>rval()</code> follows
	the pointer to the target value. An alternative is to
	build /abstract syntax trees/ in one phase and then
	traverse the trees generating code based on the more
	informed context, and if the goal was to build an
	optimizing compiler, this would be necessary. This
	method requires support routines for managing the
	expression trees as well as a more complex code
	generation routine.
<li>	_<code>exp()</code> handles assignment expressions itself, and
	delegates the next lowest precedence operator, logical
	expressions, to _<code>loge()</code>. If an assignment operator is
	not found, then whatever work _<code>loge()</code> has done is the
	value of the expression. As will the other binary
	operators, the left value is saved on the stack while
	computing the right side. Note that assignment
	expressions are atypical of binary expressions in that
	they are right-associative, so it calls itself to handle
	the right-side. That is <code>a=b=c</code> is the same as <code>a=(b=c)</code>
	but not <code>(a=b)=c</code>. After computing the value on the
	right, the left value is popped to <code>ecx</code> and the
	operation is performed. In this case, an assignment from
	<code>mov [ecx],eax</code>. If the target was a byte, however, the
	opcode must be decremented to generate <code>mov [ecx],al</code>.
	The _<code>BIN()</code> macro codifies the binary idiom and uses
	the <code>opc</code> table to determine what code to generate for
	the operators based on <code>top</code>.
<li>	_<code>loge()</code>, too, is atypical in that both of its operands
	are not always evaluated. The left is always evaluated
	and if the operator is an <code>&&</code> and the value is false,
	jump over the right in failure. For <code>||</code> if true, jump
	over the right in success. Either way, <code>eax</code> is tested
	again and set to 0 or 1 for failure and success.
<li>	_<code>poste()</code> handles calls by pre-allocating the number
	of arguments from the stack and assigning them to
	ascending addresses. No type checking is done because
	no types were saved.
<li>	_<code>atome()</code> is the highest precedence expression. First,
	the special value <code>nil</code> must be checked since it would
	otherwise be recognized as a variable. Variables are
	then handled. Variables are accessed via an offset from
	the pointer register for its storage type. The <code>storeg</code>
	table maps the storage class to the address byte for
	the correct registers. As mentioned in the lexical
	analysis section, strings are not processed by <code>next()</code>.
	<code>quote()</code> reads a single character and it is added to
	the literal string ROM, <code>rom</code>, at <code>rc</code>. The value of
	the expression is the offset of the first character
	from <code>ebx</code> which points to <code>rom</code>.
